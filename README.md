# Land Use and Cropping Pattern Data for Kerala
## 1. Overview
This is to share all data files related to the research note ["Cropping Pattern Changes in Kerala, 1956&#8211;57 to 2016&#8211;17"](https://ras.org.in/index.php?Article=cropping_pattern_changes_in_kerala_1956), published in the *Review of Agrarian Studies* journal. The datasets on land use and cropping pattern statistics are available for both at the State and district level for Kerala (1956&#8211;57 to 2016&#8211;17).

Preparing a comparable dataset on land-use and cropping pattern of Kerala was a challenging engagement. Although some researchers have analysed the long-term statistics in the past, various issues had remained unaddressed at the time of writing the above note. I used the method adopted by the [International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT)](https://vdsa.icrisat.org/vdsa-mesodoc.aspx) for their district-level database, to generate comparable dataset at the level of nine composite districts (according to the administrative boundaries of 1957&#8211;58). 

I undertook this exercise as part of my Ph.D research. The research note was an outcome of the exercise. The data for this project came from publicly available resources (although I had compiled much of it from a few other secondary sources). While I did not update the data after 2016&#8211;17, it is not difficult to add this to the existing dataset since the information for latest years are freely available and can be accessed from the sources that I list in the above note. 

Finally, a note on the other dataset. The database from ICRISAT is currently hosted [here](http://data.icrisat.org/dld/src/about-dld.html). While it covers broadly the same number of years, I have not checked my data with theirs for consistency. Since I relied on similar set of sources that the ICRISAT uses, there may not be much difference at the aggregate level between the two sources. 

## 2. Data Files
There are three datasets (in six files &#8212 a .xlsx and .ods file for each dataset) associated with this repository. 
1. 

## 3. Analysis
Calculations are performed after applying sample weights (provided by the NSSO). 
Each component income (income from crop production, animal resources, etc.) is computed separately. 
These component datasets are combined together to obtain the household income.
